As a team of college students at SUNY Oswego, our project, the Machine Operation Data Interpretation Tool 2.0 (M.O.D.I.T 2.0), developed as part of the CSC 380 course, addresses the needs of production line engineers of MARQUARDT SWITCHES INC. The goal of M.O.D.I.T 2.0 is to enhance productivity within the company by providing a sophisticated software solution. Building upon the previous M.O.D.I.T system, our enhanced version features a web-based interface that empowers engineers to minimize production losses effectively. The M.O.D.I.T 2.0 application is designed to be a comprehensive tool for production line engineers, allowing them to make data-driven decisions that lead to monetary gains for the company. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as LSTM-based predictive modeling, our software enables engineers to pinpoint instances where machines deviate from optimal performance. This proactive approach not only minimizes microstops but also predicts maintenance requirements, saving both time and money for MARQUARDT SWITCHES INC. Unlike the current M.O.D.I.T system, our software goes beyond mere data interpretation. It empowers users to locate and address inefficiencies, ensuring that machines operate at their full potential. By providing actionable insights and predictive maintenance capabilities, M.O.D.I.T 2.0 equips engineers with the tools they need to optimize production processes, enhance overall productivity, and contribute to the company's success.
